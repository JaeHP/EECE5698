In a nutshell, I would say that the given text is detailed and informative, but the reason that I do not like the material very much is because it is less graphic in nature, especially in the part of 'Characteristics of map projections' and 'Grids'. A graphic example for each characteristics, and grid zones and grid boundaries would have helped a lot. This made it difficult for me to grasp what author was trying to convey. I really liked the part where author describes the history of meridians and parallels. The detailed descriptions with particular year and the references given in the text makes it easier for anyone interested in reading more details about any event. The 'Datum and the earth as an ellipsoid' could have benefitted if some images were included, but it was relatively easy to understand that part. 

The story about the prime meridian and devising an instrument (chronometer) for longitude measurement was great to read, really informative. It is interesting to know that navigational needs (measurement of longitudes) provided the means for techonological advancements for time measurement.
